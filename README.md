# Makira: A Knowledge Sharing Platform for Kirundi

**Makira** is an online platform designed to collect, share, and expand knowledge in the Kirundi language. Its goal is to create an accessible and comprehensive resource for Kirundi speakers, learners, and enthusiasts to collaborate and preserve the richness of their language, while also making it easier for everyone to contribute their knowledge.

### **What is Makira?**
Makira is a collaborative encyclopedia-style platform where users can contribute by adding words and their meanings in Kirundi. This platform aims to build a living dictionary that will be accessible to everyone who speaks, learns, or is interested in Kirundi.

The project focuses on:

- **Gathering knowledge**: Users can submit words and their meanings in Kirundi.

### **How Does It Help the Community?**
Makira offers a valuable tool for those interested in learning Kirundi, from beginners to advanced learners. The platform fosters collaboration between different generations, making it an ideal resource for:

- **Language preservation**: By documenting words and meanings, we create a lasting record of Kirundi language, which may otherwise be lost over time.
- **Education**: Students, teachers, and language enthusiasts can use the platform as an educational tool for learning and understanding Kirundi.
- **Cultural empowerment**: The project fosters a sense of pride and ownership over the Kirundi language and helps share it with a wider audience, both locally and internationally.
